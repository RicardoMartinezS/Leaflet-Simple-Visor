# 🗺️ Basic Exercise with Leaflet

This project presents an **interactive web map viewer** built with **Leaflet**, designed as an introductory example to understand the fundamentals of web-based geographic visualization.

## 🌍 Features

- **Loading GeoJSON files** to visualize local geospatial data.  
- **Consuming WMS (Web Map Service)** layers from remote geospatial servers.  
- **Interactive Pop-ups** that display attribute information from map features.  

When the viewer is launched, a **welcome modal** is displayed, briefly describing the purpose and components of this exercise.

## 🎯 Purpose

This example serves as a **starting point for learning** how to develop basic web mapping applications using open-source technologies. It demonstrates how to integrate different geospatial data sources and interact with them through a clean and lightweight interface.

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) — Open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.  
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface and interactivity.  
- Optional integration with WMS/GeoJSON data sources.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.  
3. Interact with the map — explore layers, click on features, and view pop-ups.
